\# AI Conversation Log (minimal — error debugging only)



\*\*Model / Tool:\*\* ChatGPT (used for brief debugging \& guidance)  

\*\*Date:\*\* 2025-09-06 (approx.)



> Note: this log contains only the \*error-related\* prompts I used the AI for (install / runtime errors, network/CORS, attendance check issues). I used the AI for quick fixes (~20% of total work) and performed the rest of the implementation and testing myself.



---



\## 1) Prompt / Issue

\*\*User (prompt):\*\*  

`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`  

(terminal output shown when running `py run.py`)



\*\*AI response (summary):\*\*  

\- Likely cause: Python packages not installed in the active virtualenv.  

\- Fix recommended:

&nbsp; 1. Activate virtualenv (`venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1` or `venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat`).

&nbsp; 2. Install Flask or all dependencies: `pip install Flask` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

&nbsp; 3. Verify with `pip show Flask` and then run `py run.py` again.



\*\*My note (what I did):\*\*  

I ran `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the venv, verified `pip show flask`, and the error was resolved.

\## 2) Prompt / Issue

\*\*User (prompt):\*\*  

`(venv) D:\\campus-events\\backend>py run.py` →  

`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask\_cors'`



\*\*AI response (summary):\*\*  

\- Cause: `flask-cors` missing.  

\- Fix recommended:

&nbsp; 1. Install via `pip install flask-cors` in the active venv.

&nbsp; 2. Add `from flask\_cors import CORS` and `CORS(app)` in `app/\_\_init\_\_.py` (dev-friendly: allow all origins).

&nbsp; 3. Restart the backend.



\*\*My note (what I did):\*\*  

I installed `flask-cors`, added `CORS(app)` to the app factory, restarted the server — backend accepted cross-origin requests and the error disappeared.



---



\## 3) Prompt / Issue

\*\*User (prompt):\*\*  

`Network Error` shown in the frontend when attempting admin check-in (Mark Attendance). Browser console / axios shows a network error rather than a JSON response.



\*\*AI response (summary):\*\*  

\- Likely causes: backend not running, wrong baseURL, CORS blocking, https/http mismatch, or firewall.  

\- Quick checks and fixes:

&nbsp; 1. Confirm backend running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (visit `/api/v1/events` in browser or `curl` it).

&nbsp; 2. Ensure frontend baseURL uses the same host (use `http://localhost:5000/api/v1` in `api.js`).

&nbsp; 3. Enable CORS in backend (`pip install flask-cors` + `CORS(app)`).

&nbsp; 4. Check browser console network tab for CORS errors or blocked mixed content.

&nbsp; 5. Test via `curl` to rule out frontend issues.



\*\*My note (what I did):\*\*  

I verified the backend was running, added CORS (see item 2), set frontend baseURL to `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`, and re-tested — network error was resolved.

\## 4) Prompt / Issue

\*\*User (prompt):\*\*  

"When marking attendance, the UI shows an error — students enter details and mark attendance but the server responds with an error (e.g., 'student not found' or 'not registered for event')."



\*\*AI response (summary):\*\*  

\- Diagnosed common causes: student UID mismatch, `college\_id` mismatch, missing registration row.  

\- Recommended actions:

&nbsp; 1. Inspect DB: `SELECT \* FROM students WHERE student\_uid='S123' AND college\_id=1;` and `SELECT \* FROM registrations WHERE event\_id=1 AND student\_id=...;`.

&nbsp; 2. Option A (strict): require pre-registration — show clear error to admin.

&nbsp; 3. Option B (convenience): auto-create a registration for walk-ins (code sample provided).

&nbsp; 4. Improve frontend to show backend error text (console log + toast) for debugging.

&nbsp; 5. Use curl to reproduce and confirm exact backend JSON error.



\*\*My note (what I did):\*\*  

I added better toast/error display in the Check-In UI and opted to enable \*\*auto-registration\*\* in the backend attendance route during the prototype so walk-ins are accepted. I also ran SQL checks to verify records during testing.

\## Summary of AI usage \& my final decisions

\- I used the AI primarily for \*\*debugging runtime errors\*\* (install issues, CORS, connectivity) and for a quick recommendation about attendance behavior (auto-register vs strict).  

\- I accepted the AI suggestions for environment fixes (install packages, enable CORS) and used its guidance to implement a safe auto-registration option for the prototype.  

\- The rest of the design, code structure, UI styling, SQL schema, and reports were implemented and written by me (manual work \& custom decisions).  

\- Sensitive information (passwords, tokens) is \*\*not\*\* included in this log.
